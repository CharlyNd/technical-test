# Technical test

## Introduction

Here is a quick test to see how you adapt to a new project, how you debug and write some code, on some already existing.
Some bugs are left and we need you to fix those. Don't spend to much time on it. Average time of the test should be around 2 hours. 3 hours is the maximum. 4 hours is too much.

We need you to follow these steps to understand the app and to fix the bug : 
 - Sign up to the app
 - Create at least 2 others users on people page ( not with signup ) 
 - Edit these profiles and add aditional information 
 - Create a project
 - Input some information about the project
 - Input some activities to track your work in the good project
  
Then, see what happens in the app and fix the bug you found doing that.

## Then
Implement a new small feature to complement the app.

### The goal is to fix at least 3 bugs and implement 1 quick win feature than could improve it

## Setup api

- cd api
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm run dev`

## Setup app

- cd app
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm run dev`

## Finally

Send us the project and answer to those simple questions : 
- What bugs did you find ? How did you solve these and why ? 
- Which feature did you develop and why ? 
- Do you have any feedback about the code / architecture of the project and what was the difficulty you encountered while doing it ?
